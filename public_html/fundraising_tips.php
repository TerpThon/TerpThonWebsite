		<div id="canning" class="tab-pane fade in">
			<h2>Canning</h2>
			The term "canning" is the word that Dance Marathoners use when we refer to canister solicitation. This is an incredibly valuable tool in your fundraising efforts when done properly. We will provide you with the canning materials, and an internal Terp Thon member will accompany you to assist as well. <!--A total of 10 people may go canning per date listed (not including the internal members), with 5 of those at most being from one group/organization. -->
			<h3>Some canning tips and guidelines!</h3>
			<ol>
			<li><b>Know your stuff.</b> Know what Terp Thon is and what we do. The internal members canning with you will give you a small spiel before you begin, and we will provide small strips with a Terp Thon elevator pitch as well.</li>
			<li><b>Wear Terp Thon gear.</b> If you have it, flaunt it! If not, ask a friend if you may borrow a shirt. Then again, you could always buy one through us, FTK as usual!</li>
			<li><b>Have fun!</b> People want to donate to fun, outgoing, and passionate people. Going along with the last tip, we actually find that people who wear costumes tend to pull in the most money #ForTheKids. </li>
			<li><b>Be polite.</b> Don't overwhelm people or bug them. If they don't want to donate, they'll either make it perfectly clear or you'll just get the feeling. Either way, know which direction to take the conversation. Reply with: "Thanks for listening, check out www.TerpThon.org and like us on Facebook. Have a good day!"</li>
			<li>Please remember you are representing Terp Thon, Children's National, Children's Miracle Network Hopsitals, and the University of Maryland while canning. We are a professional organization raising money for children, so <b>keep it appropriate!</b></li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Letter Writing Campaigns</h2> 

			<p>Every year, Terp Thon hosts numerous Letter Writing events on campus.  
			Dancers come and write personalized letters to friends, families, and 
			co-workers to help solicit donations for our Miracle Children and their families. 
			All that you need is a few addresses, and Terp Thon handles mailing the letters, 
			providing stationeary, etc. Not only does letter writing spread the Terp Thon word, 
			but letters result in an average donation of $50! As if that were not awesome enough, 
			our Letter Writing Campaigns usually involve free food!</p> <!-- - check out all of our fall 2015 campaign dates here!</p>-->

			Hello [Donor Name]! 
                        <br><br>
                       On Saturday, March 4th, I will stand on my feet for 12 hours at Terp Thon, University of Maryland’s Dance Marathon that benefits Children’s National Health System.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Terp Thon</b> is a student organization that works year-round to raise funds and awareness for Children's National in Washington D.C. Our efforts culminate in our annual Dance Marathon, where we reveal our fundraising total for the year and celebrate with Miracle Families from the hospital. This year, Terp Thon has pledged to be <b>bigger, bolder, so the kids can be stronger</b>. We have set a goal to raise <b>1 million dollars</b> to make miracles possible for kids like Samerya.
                       <br><br>
                       Samerya was born with FSGS/Nephrotic Syndrome, which is disease of the kidneys. Despite her condition, she continually inspires us to live life to the fullest each and every day. She stole the show at our Dance Marathon last year with her dance moves and bubbly personality. When she grows up, she wants to be a nurse just like the ones who treated her at Children’s National!
                        <br><br>
                        I am participating in Terp Thon to help make a difference in the lives of others, and I am asking you to join me in supporting this cause. Terp Thon is only successful because of the incredible help of family and friends.
                         <br><br>
                        Donations to the hospital can provide patients with: 
                       <ul>
                             <li>10 toiletry kits for families whose children are unexpectedly admitted to the hospital ($50)</li>
                            <li>7 Meal tickets for families who can’t afford to eat in the cafeteria while they’re staying in the hospital ($100)</li>
                            <li>A one-night stay in a nearby hotel for out-of-town families ($250)</li>
                            <li>7 hypothermia blankets ($500)</li>
                      </ul>
