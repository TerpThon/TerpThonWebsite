<h2>Miracle Maker - $240</h2>
<p>A miracle maker is any dancer who raises $240! <br />
$240 means that you have raised $20 for every hour you are dancing!</p>

$240 it also buys the following things for our hospital:
<ul>
<li><b>200 specialized pacifiers</b> for babies in our NICU so that they can be soothed by a pacifier and still use the oxygen tubes they need</li>
<li><b>400 preemie diapers</b> for babies in our NICU- these diapers are extra small so that the babies' legs can fit properly and continue to grow correctly so they will later be able to walk and run normally</li>
<li><b>16 meal tickets</b> for families who can't afford to eat in the cafeteria while they are staying here with their child</li>
<li><b>2 nights in a hotel room</b> for a family who traveled a long distance to come to the hospital and need a place to stay
<li><b>40 packs of Uno cards</b> to entertain the kids that are stuck in their rooms (Uno is the most popular game in the hospital)</li>
<li><b>4 months of a wireless card</b> for a parent's laptop so that they can work from the hospital while their child is being treated here.</li>
<li><b>48 packages of toiletries</b> (shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, etc.) for families whose children are unexpectedly admitted to the hospital, and they need basics to get by for a day or two.</li>
<li><b>12 "Be the Boss of Your Body Kits"</b> used by the Child Life Department to teach children how to manage stress and pain with interactive items</li>
<li><b>26 "Be the Boss of Your Pain Book for Kids"</b> used by the Child Life Department to help teach kids pain management techniques</li>
<li><b>221 Smiley Face Squeeze Balls</b> used by the Child Life Department to teach relaxation techniques to children who are anxious about treatment</li>
