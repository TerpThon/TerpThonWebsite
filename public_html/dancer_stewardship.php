<p>Terp Thon's dancer stewardship program aims to recognize individual dancers who have gone above and beyond their fundraising minimum. Each level of fundraising represents a specific milestone and upon reaching that level the individual will be notified accordingly. As dancers increase their fundraising totals For The Kids they will receive special incentives which are listed at each level below.</p>
