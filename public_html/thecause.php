Children's National Health System is a member of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, an alliance of 170 hospitals across North America with two simple goals: Help as many children as possible by raising funds for children's hospital services, and keep funds in the community in which they were raised to help local children.
<h4 style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold;">That means your gift to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals will help make miracles happen for Maryland and Washington D.C. children who courageously face health challenges greater than most of us can imagine.
