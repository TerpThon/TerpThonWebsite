							<br>Alexander was diagnosed with hypotonic cerebral palsy at age 3 and has since spent countless days at Children’s National working on his mobility with the occupational and physical therapy team. Alexander keeps plenty busy with swimming, singing in his church choir, taking karate lessons, and being a Cub Scout. Alexander is known to be one of the toughest judges for Terp Thon’s annual a cappella competition, in which his brutally honest critiques are often the most entertaining of the night. In 2011, Alexander and his twin sister Tess were named DC’s Children’s Miracle Network Champions. “Our kids can’t always do what their peers can do. But being a part of the Children’s Miracle Network gives them the opportunity to do what their peers can’t,” said their mother.

Today, she is proud to be on the honor roll and is involved in a variety of activities – swimming, taking karate lessons, singing in her church choir, and participating in  Girl Scouts as a Brownie. Tess says that her proudest moment was when she was able to answer high school level questions at a U.S. Naval Academy interview. Tess and her twin brother Alexander were named DC’s 2011 Children’s Miracle Network Champions. Tess is a self proclaimed a cappella enthusiast and looks forward to  attending Terp Thon’s annual a cappella show every spring!							<br><br>

<br>Nothing can stop Amanda - not a bone cancer diagnosis, not fourteen rounds of chemotherapy, and certainly not a prosthetic leg. Just after her second birthday, Amanda was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma and immediately underwent treatment at Children’s National. At only two-and-a-half years old, she had her left leg amputated and replaced with a prosthesis, which she now affectionately refers to as her “J-leg.” Amanda is able to run and play like any other 8th grader – in fact, her friends have a hard time keeping up with her. Amanda is one of the fastest girls on her soccer team and is proud to say that she has scored a goal with her J-leg! She is a fan favorite at Terp Thon and rallies the crowd with her rendition of “Stronger” by Kelly Clarkson, while dancing around on her J-leg. Says Amanda, “I had cancer. Now, thanks to Children’s National, I have a really cool robot leg that helps me walk. Everyone in my class wishes they had a robot leg, too!”							<br><br>

<br>At just 2 years old, Brooke went from playing on the playground to being diagnosed with acute myeloid Leukemia in the blink of an eye. Brooke immediately started chemotherapy but doctors said a bone marrow transplant was necessary to save her life. Luckily, Brooke’s sister Caitlin was a perfect match willingly stepped up to save her sister’s life. Brooke is now six and there are no signs of the cancer recurring! Her rendition of “Let It Go” from Frozen and “Roar” by Katy Perry at past Terp Thons has defined her as annual show-stealer. Brooke dreams of someday being able to “fly and eat all candy,” but in the mean time, spends her days riding bikes and playing Polly Pockets with her sister. Brooke and Caitlin have a bond like no other sisters and are the best of friends.							<br><br>

<br>Sisters share a lot of things: toys, clothes, and for some, even bone marrow. Caitlin was just five years old when her younger sister, Brooke, was diagnosed with leukemia. A bone marrow transplant was Brooke’s best chance for survival, and Caitlin happened to be a perfect match. Without fear, Caitlin volunteered herself to save her sister’s life. Now, five years later, the two are both healthy with a bond stronger than most. The transplant did not slow Caitlin down at all; she has participated in races and kid’s dashes that benefit causes such as Children’s National and cancer research. She is an ambitious gymnast who stole the show with a floor routine at this past Terp Thon and was named DC’s 2014 Children’s Miracle Network Champion, along with Brooke! 							<br><br>

<br>When Carsten first thought about what he wanted from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he knew that he wanted it to benefit other kids. He ended up designing a board game to teach kids about cancer - a subject he knew very well because he had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia only two years prior. Carsten underwent chemotherapy at Children’s National and went into remission when he was 12! In 2012, he spoke at a pre-race event for the Cherry Blossom Run and went on to run the 5k. He was also featured on special edition boxes of Kellogg’s Cheez-It crackers as part of a campaign to benefit Children’s Miracle Network. 							<br><br>

<br>Chase was 3 years old when he accidentally dipped his toothbrush into a lye-based drain cleaner, ingesting some of it. He was unable to swallow or breathe due to the damage on his epiglottis and esophagus. He spent three weeks at Children’s National PICU until he was stable enough to undergo surgery. The scarring in his throat narrowed his airway and required him to get a tracheotomy. Luckily for Chase, his vocal chords and voice box were not damaged and the tracheotomy should be removed by adulthood. Chase is now nine years old and a happy and healthy child. He enjoys coming to  Terp Thon’s annual Halloween parties, dressing up, and scaring people! 							<br><br>

Multiple EEGs, CT scans, and MRIs were inconclusive until she met with a cardiologist at Children’s National. Courtney was diagnosed with neurally mediated hypotension, which is low blood pressure from faulty brain signals that leads to nausea, dizziness, and fainting. Courtney continues to go to Children’s National for checkups and treatment. Today, she enjoys gymnastics, playing piano, and swimming.

After experiencing breathing problems when he was five-and-a-half months old, Ian went into Children’s National for testing. He found out that his RSV tests were positive and his heart was enlarged. As a result of this severe coarctation of the aorta, Ian required heart surgery. Luckily, the removal of the narrowed section of his aorta was successful and to date, Ian loves seeing the doctors at Children’s National! He views them as his heroes because he is now able to play sports. Ian also inspired a Mini Dance Marathon at Resnik Elementary School, raising $1,150 FTK during their second year!							<br><br>

<br>Jack’s life strategy is simple to him: when faced with difficulties, he thinks back to his battle with cancer. Now, everything else seems easy in comparison to fighting and beating his disease. When he was 10 years old, Jack was diagnosed with diabetes and eventually germinoma after exploratory brain surgery. He underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and was declared in remission after three months! He is now 17 years old and a member of the golf team at his high school. Jack is often seen playing with a PING hat that was gifted to him by pro golfer Hunter Mahan during his Make-A-Wish trip. Jack says about his fight with cancer, “It gave me a new perspective on life that you can’t really take life for granted. You gotta look at the little things and appreciate them, just know how many blessings you have.”

							Jaiwen always knew he wanted to give back to Children’s National – after all, it had become his second home and the doctors there saved his life. 
							When Jaiwen was 11-years-old, a soccer injury turned out to be osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer.  He underwent a year of chemotherapy and had part of his left femur amputated and replaced with a titanium prosthesis, which required him to learn how to walk again. He also has a titanium bar spanning his chest, and his family has since affectionately dubbed him “Man of Titanium.” Jaiwen started Walk Away Cancer in the fall of 2014 at his high school to raise money and awareness for pediatric cancer. The event raised $24,514.69 for Children’s National’s Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders in just its first year! He currently serves as Class President, is an aspiring poet, and enjoys giving motivational speeches about his experiences.

<br>Anyone seeing Jessica perform on stage would never guess that she was born with spina bifida. When Jessica was born four weeks prematurely, she was immediately transferred to Children’s National for spinal surgery. To aid her in regaining balance and stability, hospital staff suggested that Jessica’s parents enroll her in a martial arts or ballet class. Now 16 years old, Jessica holds a green belt in kung fu and loves dancing and singing on stage at Terp Thon. She is no longer required to attend physical therapy and aspires to become a doctor one day! 							<br><br>

							<br>Not many people can say they got Terps Football coach Randy Edsall to Dougie with him on stage, but Joey sure can. In between crowdsurfing and playing basketball at various Terp Thon events, Joey also maintains “Lights Out Leukemia,” which updates supporters about his medical journey. Joey was first diagnosed with high risk T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the summer of 2008 and relapsed in August of 2010. Through his intense treatment, Joey turned to one of his biggest idols to draw strength. Joey is a huge football fanatic, more specifically, a huge Tim Tebow fan. In the midst of a five day chemotherapy regimen, Joey decided to take a moment to give thanks on a bended knee, just as he had seen Tebow do countless times on the football field. A picture of him doing so during treatment went viral and was coined “Tebowing While Chemoing.” In 2012, the Tim Tebow Foundation flew Joey out to meet Tebow and watch him play! As of 2014, Joey has been cancer free and hopes to become a future Terp!

<br>When Jordan was 8 years old, he came down with a fever and headache that led to a sinus infection.

Unfortunately, the infection returned and surgeons had to perform a second craniotomy. After relearning how to walk and talk, Jordan was able to regain enough strength to play football and wrestle for his high school team!

<br>Jozlyn loves being a cheerleader - she cheered for a Little League baseball team a few years ago, and continues to cheer today. However, she wouldn’t have been able to do so without Children’s National. Says Jozlyn, “When I came to Children’s National, all I wanted to be was a cheerleader, but I was in too much pain.” Jozlyn has sickle-cell disease, which prevents her from taking part in typical activities that most kids can, like playing in the snow, or going to the pool, because of many complications and the significant amount of time required in the hospital. However, in 2010, Jozlyn had a successful bone marrow transplant and is now reunited with her love of cheerleading! She also enjoys trying out different nail polish designs and even creating her own. Jozlyn says, “my follow-up care ensures that my pain relief is permanent. Now I can join my friends on the sidelines and I’m jumping for joy!” 							<br><br>

<br>For Kierslyn, the Pain Clinic at Children’s National was the only place she could find relief. When she was only 7 months old, Kierslyn was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This marked the start of a long journey filled with excruciating pain, wheelchairs, and missed school days. However, due to the innovative pain management tactics at Children’s National, Kierslyn’s doctors were able give her neck, back, and hip injections to manage her pain and help her return to a normal life of going to school, watching sports, and playing computer games. Kierslyn hopes to become a Terp one day and study computer science! 							<br><br>

<br>Luca was born with urea cycle disorder, a rare genetic disorder that inhibits the liver from processing proteins. Her condition was so severe that at 4 months old Luca was in need of a liver transplant, but finding a match at the time was very difficult. Thankfully, her father was tested as a match and was able to donate some of his liver to her. The surgery was successful and after months of being in and out of the hospital, Luca is now residing at home! Today, Luca is a happy and healthy four year old who enjoys listening to music and playing with her dog Tessa. In 2014, Luca and her family participated in Children’s National’s Race For Every Child 5K in which they raised $1,317.00 to give back to the hospital. Says Luca’s mother Katie, “‘Thank you’ just doesn’t seem to be quite enough, but for the [Children’s National] doctors, nurses, technicians, and staff who we never thought we’d need, but have helped Luca, thank you.” 							<br><br>

Micah has been going to Children’s National for physical therapy ever since she was two weeks old, where she works on her stability, balance and strength, as well as developing her play skills.

							<br>One summer night, when Noble was 5, he was out playing in his yard while his dad was mowing the lawn. Somehow, Noble’s leg got caught under the blades of the lawnmower, destroying his Achilles tendon and  most of his calf muscle. Doctors at Children’s National had hoped to save his leg but unfortunately had to amputate the lower part to give him the best quality of life. However, the amputation did not slow Noble down in anyway. Months after the surgery, Noble started kindergarten, walking in with his “bionic, transformers leg.” Now 11, Noble can do everything other kids can do! Noble loves to swim and play golf, and his prosthetic doesn’t stop him from leading dance lines at Terp Thon. Noble was named the 2015 DC’s Children’s Miracle Network Champion, and traveled to Atlanta in summer 2015 to advocate for funding for the Network! 							<br><br>

<br>For the first 94 days of Ryan’s life, he slept in an incubator in Children’s National’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. His big toe was the size of a tic-tac, and he was diagnosed with Dandy Walker syndrome and hydrocephalus, both of which are brain abnormalities that that cause excess fluid in the brain. He underwent multiple surgeries to control the fluid buildup and reduce his seizures. Ryan is now a thriving 9 year-old boy and, says his parents, “Today Ryan…walks, talks, runs, screams, kicks, throws, and terrorizes the family cat.” In 2008, George W. Bush honored Ryan by naming him a member of the “President’s Committee on People with Intellectual Disabilities.” The Cole family started a non-profit group, the Dandy Walker Alliance Inc., that helps to raise awareness and funding for Dandy-Walker syndrome, as well as to unite other families in this common goal.							<br><br>

							<br>The first time Tara shared her inspirational story on stage at Terp Thon, the entire room was filled with echoes of the audience chanting her name in solidarity and awe. In February 2013, Tara was diagnosed with grade 2 astrocytoma, a rare form of brain cancer. Doctors found three tumors in her brain that were inoperable, so she began 70 weeks of chemotherapy. In January 2015, more tumors were discovered and so Tara is continuing to receive treatment at Children’s National today. Despite the countless surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy, Tara enjoys playing softball, training her dog Caroline, and taking selfies with her friends and family!

							<br> At five months old,  Trevor was away at Ocean City on one of his family’s weekend trips when his first symptoms occurred. He was vomiting nonstop and was soon flown to Children’s National, where was diagnosed with ependymoma. He had a brain tumor the size of a tennis ball that was sitting on his occipital lobe. He underwent six months of chemotherapy and, in January 2012, an MRI showed he was cancer free! Trevor is now 4 years old and is often accompanied to Terp Thon events with his siblings. He is an active and exuberant child and loves running around and keeping up with his older brother.

<br>In March 2013, Zach collapsed on the track while running for his high school ROTC program. He was found to be unresponsive and flat-lined three times while being transported to his local hospital. Zach was then airlifted to Children’s National to have an internal cardiac device inserted to assist his heart. Thanks to the doctors at Children’s, he is now back to playing sports! Only 7% of people survive the type of cardiac arrest Zach had, and he was lucky to be one of them! 							<br><br>

<br>Zoie was just a typical toddler playing on the playground when she fell, and everything changed. While giving her a bath, her mother noticed some swelling on her left side. When the swelling did not subside after two weeks, Zoie’s mother took her in to get X-rays and was immediately referred to Children’s National. Zoie was diagnosed with stage 4 Wilms Tumor and endured six months of chemo and surgery to remove her left kidney. Despite all of this, Zoie was still a happy child who was not upset over losing her hair. Now eight years old, Zoie is cancer free! She loves gymnastics, swimming, ballet, and playing with her little sister Kaia. 							<br><br>
