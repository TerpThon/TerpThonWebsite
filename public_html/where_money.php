Yet, the concept of Seacrest Studios is much more than what meets the eye: it has the ability to whisk kids away from the pain and monotony that accompanies a hospital stay. Patients can come down to Seacrest Studios or watch from their rooms, laughing during the clown show, dreaming of far off lands during the storytelling segments, flexing their mental muscles during the trivia questions, and singing and dancing during the radio hour. Seacrest Studios at Children’s National is one of 10 in pediatric hospitals across the country; they are funded by the Ryan Seacrest Foundation and generous local and national supporters.</p><br>
