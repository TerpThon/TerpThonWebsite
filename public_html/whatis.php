        <p>Terp Thon’s fundraising success is a direct result of our close relationship with our Miracle Families and Children’s National. It is through our <a href="/miraclekids.php">Miracle Kids</a> that we stay motivated to <b>be the best we can be</b>. Throughout the year, Terp Thon has events which unites patients at Children’s National and the UMD community. At our Dance Marathon, the Miracle Kids come together to celebrate their strength, and are able to <i>show off their inner rock star!</i> Last year, Amanda sung her heart out to a Katy Perry song, and Caitlin gave an amazing gymnastics performance. Most importantly, the Miracle Kids, Terp Thon Planning Team, and UMD student body all have fun as <b>we unite under one cause.</b> </p>
